# zipcode_optimization

 Uses facts about zipcodes in the United States to deduce a user's state location based on their zipcode if location access is not available.

This is intended as logical scaffolding to optimize what listings to show in the absence of user location access for a [project I work on](https://offroadfunfinder.com).

Also addresses edge cases where states in different zipcode groups border each other.

Here's some of the scratch work I did via ExcaliDraw (awesome tool, highly recommend) when I was working through the idea of implementing this repo.
